# üõ©Ô∏è RC Plane with Arduino UNO/Nano

A 4-channel radio-controlled (RC) airplane project using Arduino and standard RC components. This project allows control over throttle, rudder, elevator, and aileron using a hobby-grade RC transmitter and receiver.

## üß† Arduino Code Summary

The Arduino sketch reads PWM signals from the receiver using `pulseIn()` and writes them directly to the servos and ESC using `writeMicroseconds()`. This provides near real-time control with minimal latency.

- PWM Input Range: 1000 ‚Äì 2000 microseconds
- Output: Real-time servo/motor commands

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. Bind transmitter and receiver  
2. Upload the Arduino code  
3. Power system through USB or ESC‚Äôs BEC  
4. Move transmitter sticks to test response:  
   - Throttle ‚Üí Motor spins  
   - Rudder ‚Üí Servo rotates  
   - Elevator ‚Üí Servo pitches up/down  
   - Aileron ‚Üí Servo rolls left/right

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Symptom               | Possible Cause           | Solution                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| No servo response     | Wrong wiring or no power | Check GND, pins, and power   |
| ESC doesn‚Äôt arm       | PWM out of range         | Recalibrate ESC manually     |
| Laggy response        | Software delay           | Optimize loop, debounce      |
